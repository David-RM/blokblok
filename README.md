## blokblok

This is the first game I tried to make. It's a silly testing ground and not to be taken seriously.

It can be played at https://david-rm.github.io/blokblok/. Use `a` and `d` to move. Hold `space` while moving to jump.

## Overview

blokBlok is a game where you play a Blok - a square on the screen. It is a 2D sidescrolling platformer. When you press left or right, the Blok hops in that direction with a "Blok!" sound. If you press up, the Blok jumps with a roostery "Blok-ok!" sound. 

## Future Improvements

There are powerups you can get:

One turns you into a Bol (ball), which makes a noise like "Bolllllllll" when it rolls.

One is a size increase that turns you into a BigBlok. The powerup sound is "BIIIIGGGG BLAWWWWWK" and then the hop sounds are big, heavy "BLOK" thuds.

There are Spyks (spikes) to avoid. Voiceover says "SPYK!!" when you touch one.
